Telling the story of a better version of I.T.  Opinions are my own.

I love storytelling as a way to share a concept - it's a powerful way to connect with someone's intellect and emotions at the same time.

_"What really happens is that the story-maker proves a successful 'sub-creator'. He makes a Secondary World which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is 'true': it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were, inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the Primary World again, looking at the little abortive Secondary World from outside."_ -- **J.R.R. Tolkien**
