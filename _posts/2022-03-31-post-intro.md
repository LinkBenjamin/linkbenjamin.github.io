## First Post

Welcome, all of you!  I'm using this GH Pages blog to teach myself the Segment product -> as a Dev Avocado for Segment, it's kinda important that I know how it works!  This blog will get all my rants about IT Shops and the Old Ways that just won't die.  Look for fresh hot takes here regularly once I find my feet!

### A little bit of history of Me

#### Lander University, Class of 2004

I was in the last year of the Computer Science program at Lander - afterward, they lost enough tenured staff that they had to shift the degree program to Computer Information Systems. 

#### Grede Foundries, Inc. 2005-2009

I did the small-town plant IT guy thing for a while, and greatly enjoyed it.  Learned a lot about LEAN / 6-sigma, and how it was changing manufacturing.  But then our elected officials wrecked the economy, and the plant closed.

#### BlueCross BlueShield of SC 2009-2022

I had a good friend who had gotten into an entry-level recruitment program at Blue in 2008, and when I had to start looking for a job, I reached out and he helped me land on my feet.  I uprooted my little family and moved to Columbia SC to jump into Tier II Application Support.  It was traditional, old-school Ops, complete with a phone of Death that managed to let its holder sleep about 2 hours a night.  

I spent a couple of years on the front lines of Ops, and then tried to do some reporting work for the Ops management staff, and then worked my way into a sort of Critical-research wing who could step into severe situations but mostly focused on how we could improve.  I started writing some rogue code and deploying it to a little utility server we maintained, and little by little, I began to explore the developer world - starting with the dark underbelly that had to avoid the light of Governance!

After a few years of this, I was invited to a dev team that most resemble Developer Advocates, though we as an organization had no idea what to call it.  We got labeled as "Technical Advisors".  Anyway - it was all about how to improve the way we work, and finding out what in the industry might suit our shop.  It was here that I started to finally put labels on things - DevOps, Continuous Delivery, CI/CD Pipelines, etc.  We started with some rogue systems, and then when we realized we had a win, we slowly began to make the systems legitimate.  This was a golden age of my BlueCross time - we were spearheading all sorts of crazy initiatives.  We held a DevOps Day for internal staff.  We began helping multiple teams build delivery pipelines out of their newly-minted GitHub Enterprise repositories.  We were fighting the good fight with Release Management, Governance, SecOps... to bring everybody together.

After a couple of years of limited successes there, I realized that our separate Infrastructure Teams were impossible to engage in these cool new ways... because they were so "other".  So... Nixon went to China!  I joined the Infra side of the house in a design role and began using my new space to work on increasing our agility and promoting DevOps principles among a whole bunch of engineers who didn't think they could code!  

Then the world fell apart.  COVID sent us all home, and things got all weird and stuff.  After a couple of years of that, I realized I'm not getting younger and began hunting around to see what I could do with the knowledge and experience I'd acquired - and so I joined Segment as a Developer Advocate!
